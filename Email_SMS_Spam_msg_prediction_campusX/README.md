# Brief about the project : 
spam detection using multiple classification techniques. NLP techniques used to process the msgs.

# Learning focus: 
to apply multiple classification models in a loop without using hyperparameter tuning The focus was more on precision and not accuracy for  this project.

# Steps followed:
1. Data collection (Kaggle)
2. Data cleaning
3. EDA
4. Text preprocessing : lower case, tokenize, remove stop words , stemming
5. Model Building
6. Evaluation
7. Comparison with multiple models

# Models  on focus:
1. Naives Bayes
2. SVC
3. KNN
4. Decision Trees
5. Logistic regression
6. Random Forest
7. Ada boost classifier
8. Bagging classifier
9. Gradient boosting
10. Xg Boost

# Areas of improvement : 
Can be deployed to website and also hyper parameter tuning could have been explored.
